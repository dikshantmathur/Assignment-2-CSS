			<h3><b>5 Reasons Why Changing the LBW Laws would be a Poor Move</b></h3>
			<br> 
				|<p> Changing the LBW laws | Ian Chappell’s solution to bridging the gap between bat and ball As I get ready for another Monday with coffee in hand, I stare in disbelief at my computer screen. Sitting there, I am wondering if ESPNCricinfo are so out of ideas during the COVID-19 pandemic that they have turned to satirical articles. But, I realise that ESPNCricinfo don’t really do satirical articles. Plus, Ian Chappell isn’t the kind of guy to write them. Chappell, a tough cricketer and possessor of one of the finest minds of the game, has suggested cricket changes its LBW laws once it returns. Specifically, he says that it shouldn’t matter where the ball pitches or hits the batsman; if the umpire thinks it’ll hit the stumps, you’re out. 
			“Forget where the ball pitches and whether it strikes the pad outside the line or not; if it’s going to hit the stumps, it’s out” are Chappelli’s words. But, while this might seem attractive to the bowlers, it is a bad idea for the game.</p>

			<h3><b>Exclusive: Jermain Defoe on his Rangers dream, West Ham exit and leaving Spurs twice</b></h3>
			<br>
			<p>
			 Very few players split opinion between Tottenham and West Ham fans like Jermain Defoe does. For the former, he is a goalscoring hero having scored almost 150 goals across two very successful spells in North London. For the latter, he’s a player who is perceived to have betrayed his roots by trying to leave at a time when the Hammers needed him most. But regardless of all that, the striker has enjoyed a hugely successful career, in which he has scored for every club he’s played for and is currently on a mission to help Rangers win their first SPL title since 2011. For young football fans, he’s a role model both on and off the pitch. If his goalscoring exploits for both club and country weren’t inspirational enough, his charitable work away from the pitch certainly is.</p>

			<h3><b>Penn State Nittany Lions forward Lamar Stevens was a four-year starter in the NCAA</b></h3> 
			<br>
			<p>Who is a versatile prospect on both offense and defense. Stevens was one of the more accomplished frontcourt players in the Big Ten Conference. The 22-year-old college star spoke to HoopsHype about how he has been preparing for the upcoming draft while reflecting on his experience in the NCAA. 
			Note: This transcription has been minorly edited for clarity.
			What were some of your favorite memories and experiences playing in college?
			Lamar Stevens: First of all, writing a book was the highlight of my college career. I loved being able to give back to the fans that were so good to me. Winning the NIT was also a highlight. Honestly, all of this season was an amazing experience. We sold out the Bryce Jordan Center which hadn’t been done in 10 years. We have reached rankings that have never been reached. We were breaking all types of records this year. Writing a book will definitely help you stand out among other players. Could you tell me more about it?</p>
